# External Task Tracker – Founder-Only Requirements

1. Have you registered the domain and secured hosting credentials?
2. Do you have legal setup completed (LLC, EIN, terms of use)?
3. Have your Stripe and/or App Store developer accounts been created?
4. Are there any app store login credentials, DNS records, or cloud keys we need access to?
5. Are there any human approvals, signatures, or uploads only you can provide?

Once answered, Vox will begin tracking founder-only tasks, deadline reminders, and external resource checklists.
